flare is BeReal, but for hot takes.

each day at a random time, everyone using flare will get a prompt that fits under one of the flare categories. then, you, a flarer, can submit a flare (your honest opinion) on the prompt.

you see, one of flareâ€™s developers had a hot take, thus the lack of capital letters in our design.

the catch? the post cannot be edited nor deleted once it's been posted, so once you share your take on the topic, it's there for all your friends to see. what's more? you can't see your friends answers to the prompt of the day until you reply to it. flare is the real deal.

once your flare is out for the world to see, you'll start getting replies from your friends, who may or may not be telling you that your take on the matter is atrocious... yeah, social media's actually getting social.
